# Japanese-Enhancement-Chat-Assistant

Created a web-based Japanese chat application using Python/Django and HTML/CSS. This application was created to help beginners have more avenues to learn Japanese. There are three modes they can dive into. Each of these modes help the learner develop their skills in different ways that can hopefully translate into strengthening their real world skills.

This application is using APIs from DeepL and WriteSonic. DeepL is being used to translate WriteSonic's responses and WriteSonic is being used to respond to the user's prompts. WriteSonic does have the ability to create responses while utilizing the web but I have disabled search in this current version.
